## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Finished the mock models for hedgehogs and created a rest api framework off of them. In addition, I created a simple header for the django project app.


## This Week's Plan
> Connect to actual tables for project worked on by the data pipeline team. In addition, work on search bar functionality to search up graphs. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have not created any container in docker and am currently running it locally.
