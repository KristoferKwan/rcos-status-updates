## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Began setting up docker as well as python modules.

## This Week's Plan

> Better coordinate with Ranjit to determine what to do for the rest api.

## Anything Blocking?

> Docker is not complete/updated. In addition, do not have a solid understanding of the resulting rest api
