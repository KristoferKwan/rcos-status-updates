## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Coordinated with group lead about REST API and its applications to 
> Hedgehogs project. Did not do too much coding due to classes


## This Week's Plan

> Create a standalone branch to act as a template REST API, get used 
> to REST API in Django

## Anything Blocking?

> cannot install pgcli onto my pc, connect to the postgres database 
> for hedgehogs
